      <p>Hi, I'm Mensun Wang, a Computer Science student at Boston University with a strong passion for full-stack
        development and machine learning. I am dedicated to exploring their applications in solving real-world
        challenges and continuously refining my expertise in building efficient, data-driven applications.</p>
      <p>Welcome to my personal websiteâ€”an interactive and visually engaging version of my resume. Here, you'll find
        detailed insights into my skills, experience, and projects. While I no longer play Minecraft, I wanted to
        incorporate a gamified design to make this site feel both personal and creative. Feel free to explore and
        experience its responsiveness firsthand!</p>
